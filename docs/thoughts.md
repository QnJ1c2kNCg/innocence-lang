# Thoughts

> Complexity is Sin

This document will try to organize my thoughts around innocence. At this stage, this is more of a brain dump than anything remotely organized.

## Goals
* **Simplicity of usage**: innocence should be trivial to read, write and understand. The language offers a **single way** to do a thing, this means one looping construct, one conditional construct, etc...
* **Simplicity of implementation**: this implementation of innocence should thrive to be easy to understand and welcoming to play with. When an implementation trade-off between performance and simplicity is encountered, simplicity and intuitivity should win.
* **Fun**: I would like to like coding using innocence.
* **AI unfriendly**: I would like the language to be usable only by humans.

## Non-goals
* Performance (it would probably be good to define)
* Production usage
* Long running programs (for now)



## Languages features / notes
* No methods? just function in the namespace that take a struct?
* No multi-threading
* Nothing implicit
* Do we want nested functions? no
